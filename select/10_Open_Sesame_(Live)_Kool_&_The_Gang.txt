Tried every way to get your love
Everything in my power
Even prayed to the man above
Broke my baby's heart for you
Divided my family
Cause Women like you are so few
Gave up right for wrong
The silly dreams I had
That someday your heart I'll own

Open Sesame
Only if I were a Jennie
Open Sesame
Open your heart
Let love invade it's privacy
Opens Sesame
Only if I were a Jennie
Open Sesame
Set your heart free

I need you girl
Your rejection is like a twister
Tearing up my whole world
Blowing away the leaves
From the trees of happiness
Took the sweetness of my heart
And left it with bitterness
Said you wanted to love me
But, wasn't strong enough
To open the doors to flow free

Open Sesame
Only if I were a Jennie
Open Sesame
Open your heart
Let love invade it's privacy
Open Sesame
Only if i were a Jennie
Open Sesame
Set your hear free
