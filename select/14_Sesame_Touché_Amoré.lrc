[00:06.07] If you're looking for a place
[00:08.79] To hang your head in shame
[00:11.40] The light is always on
[00:14.11] So come on in
[00:28.22] My eyes are too big for my stomach
[00:31.82] It can't process all that I do
[00:34.50] A rich diet of endless endeavors
[00:37.30] At the expense of me and you
[00:42.96] There's a thousand reasons why I can't open up
[00:48.56] Every combination is one turn off
[00:54.64] There's no rest for the weak
[00:59.11] I need a week's rest desperately
